This is the code and datasets for Part 3.1: Real Data.  I found multiple data sets from data.gov, and started with the 2018 data set for Turnstiles for the NYC Metro.  This data quickly became unweidly, however, and my python code wouldn't create meaningful plots.  I was able to get the code to display the entry and exit data by station (there are 377 station), however I still couldn't get any plots to work. 
Going back to my roots, I dug deeper in the data, remembering from my many visits to NYC that not all stations have escalators.  I found in the data.gov data set another data file for Entrance and Exit data.  This file includes a list of the entrances and exits by station that have escalators, stairs, and/or elevators.  There are only a handful of stations that actually have escalators, so the data I ran was on those stations.  The results are in this folder.
